start the face detection
perform landmark extraction

### Update 23 Nov 2021:

All members of the group managed to successfully implement Face Tracking using Unity AR Foundation. This way we were able to detect the face on an android device. 

The main challenges faced were: compatibility with android devices and successfully configuring the building options.

Successfully implemented the anchoring between the face points and the 3d lens model in unity.
